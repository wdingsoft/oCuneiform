  <p>This small amulet, masterfully carved from a thin piece of white indurated limestone, takes the shape of a turtle,
    with incised lines on each flipper, raised arched circular body, and protruding head with bulging eyes and incised
    line for the mouth. The underside with a pierced hole for suspension through the neck. The surface highly polished
    on both sides, revealing the fine grain of the stone. <br> <br> <em>Turtles and tortoises are incorporated into many
      religious traditions and mythologies throughout the Mediterranean world and ancient Egypt. In ancient Mesopotamia,
      the turtle was associated with the god Ea in Akkadian and Babylonian mythology, Enki in Sumerian mythology. He was
      originally patron god of the city of Eridu, but later the influence of his cult spread throughout Mesopotamia and
      to the Hittites and Hurrians. He was the deity of crafts, seawater, intelligence, and creation. Considered the
      master shaper of the world, god of wisdom and of all magic.</em></p>
