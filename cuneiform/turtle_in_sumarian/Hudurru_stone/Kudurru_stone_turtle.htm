        The god Ea (whose Sumerian equivalent was Enki) is one of the three most powerful gods in the Mesopotamian
        pantheon, along with <a href="../../listofdeities/an/index.html" id="d2e4547" title="An/Anu (god)">Anu</a> and

        the ocean underneath the earth called the abzu (Akkadian <i id="d2e4553">apsû</i>), which was an important place
        in Mesopotamian cosmic geography. For example, the city of Babylon was said to have been built on top of the
        abzu.

    <p id="d2e4557">Sumerian texts about Enki often include overtly sexual portrayals of his virile masculinity. In
        particular, there is a metaphorical link between the life-giving properties of the god's semen and the animating
        nature of fresh water from the abzu. Until recently, however, many of the more explicit details have been
        suppressed in modern translations (see <a href="../../bibliography/index.html#cooper_1989" id="d2e4559"

        in his house because he is "constantly terrified" of what will happen (<a

        turtle from the clay of the abzu to help him recover the stolen tablet of destinies, which controls humanity's
        future. The tablet was stolen by an evil bird-like demon named Anzu, but the hero Ninurta won it back. Ninurta,
        however, decided to keep it for himself rather than return it to Enki. Yet the ever-cunning Enki thwarted
        Ninurta's ambitions by creating a turtle that grabbed Ninurta by the heel, dug a pit with its claws and dragged
        the overambitious hero into it. Though the story is incomplete, presumably the tablet was returned to Enki, and
        Ninurta was taught a valuable lesson regarding the corrupting nature of power.</p>
